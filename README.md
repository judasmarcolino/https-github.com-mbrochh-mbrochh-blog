This repository holds my blog which you can see at
[martinbrochhaus.com](http://martinbrochhaus.com).

It is generated by [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) and hosted
on [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/).

If you find any errors or amendments to my articles, I would be more than glad
to merge your pull request. Please just submit patches to the .md files in the
folder `content`, don't worry about generating the .html output with Pelican.
