WORK IN PROGRESS...

The World Health Organization counts the [years of life
lost](http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/daly_rates/en/) due to
disabilities and mortality every year. Someone should do the same for social
networks: I don't really see the difference between a person not contributing
to society because she is tied to a wheel-chair and a person watching cat
movies on YouTube or playing Candy Crush. Social networks are like sugar,
cigarettes, alcohol and fast food: We all know that they are unhealthy but we
just don't have the strength to stay away from them.

## Why this post?

2014 turned out to be a fantastic year for me but I wasn't even half as
productive as I used to be. If I want to get any further in life in 2015 I need
to change something. I have many ideas on how to improve but one idea keeps
coming back to me:

I need to re-view my social network usage.

In the beginning, I signed up out of curiosity, without any special
expectations or purpose. I quickly understood how these apps could be used to
achieve certain goals and so I had created a personal agenda on how to use them
(and why to use them). However, over time, they became mainstream and changed
the way we use the internet, they changed the way we interact with other people
and maybe even the way we work as a society. Until now, I just swam with the
stream. I never mindfully looked at these changes and asked myself if they are
good or bad and if I want to be part of this or not. It all boils down to:

I don't know why I post food porn on Facebook. Everyone seems to do it, so I
just do it as well.

## Pros & Cons of each network?

* Facebook
  * Pro: Everyone is there
  * Pro: Stay in touch with people you like
  * Pro: Very good iOS client & mobile website
  * Pro: Easy to have conversations
  * Pro: Easy to edit typos in posts
  * Con: My very best friends all don't use it, they only observe
  * Pro/Con: Never-ending interaction
  * Con: Privacy nightmare
  * Con: Once you post, you obsess with the number of likes and comments. 
         Promotes hugely narcissistic network.
  * Con: Fucking ads everywhere
  * Con: Random timelime / reload page and everything is lost / gigantic timesink
  * Con: Walled garden / not indexable
  * Con: Group pressure / no control over data about me because of mentions and
         tags
  * Verdict: Chaotic time sink. Not really worth using.

* Twitter
  * Pro: Public / indexable
  * Pro: Replaced RSS feeds 
  * Pro: Highest quality of content/links that reach me
  * Pro: Least personal information collected about me
  * Pro: Least distractive / best web interface
  * Pro: OK Search
  * Pro: Reliable static timeline
  * Pro/Con: OK iOS client
  * Con: Only professionals, no real-life friends (except nerds)
  * Con: Fucking ads getting worse now
  * Con: Terrible to have conversations / discussions
  * Con: Can't edit typos in posts
  * Verdict: Best network for professional tasks, very good content, very
             little distractions & bullshit. Almost all that I know as a
             developer was picked up on Twitter

* G+
  * Pro: Public / indexable
  * Pro: Good search
  * Pro: Easy to add typos in posts
  * Pro: Easy to have conversations
  * Pro/Con: Reliable static timeline / unless you start tuning down groups & circles
  * Pro/Con: OK web interface / annoying suggestion posts
  * Con: Least interesting content
  * Con: Groups not moderated, flooded with useless content
  * Con: Discussions full of braindead spam comments
  * Verdict: This would be the best network, the only problem is that nobody is
             is using it.

## What do social networks offer that can't be solved with other tools?

## Who profits from social networks?

* The owner
  * Ad revenue
  * Big data insights
  * Subtle controll of the masses
* Content producers
  * Inbound traffic / content going viral 
* Users
  * Organizing events with many people could be easier (i.e. Python User Group Meetups)
  * Tools for creating communities 

## Why do people want to use social networks at all?

* Be your own celebrity?
* Perfect time-filler

## What do I hope to gain from the usage?

* Stay in touch with people, especially when staying abroad for long periods
* Learn about nice places / activities to do
* Build a personal brand as a consultant
* Gain trust in my readership, prove to be a good gatekeeper, links that I post
  are worth your time
* Learn about new technologies / best practices

* Subconsciously:
  * Gain a followship = illusion of more power to change the world

## How do I use social networks at the moment?

* Facebook
  * Since March 2009
  * 361 Friends + 1 Following
  * 58 Followers
  * Share personal and lame stuff with close friends and family
  * 93 posts in 24hrs
  * 1 ad at the top

* Twitter
  * Since March 2009
  * 8074 Tweets
  * 539 Followers
  * 231 Following / 137 people
  * Find new technologies / share links and nerd-jokes with my IT-fellows
  * 153 posts in 24hrs
  * 7 ads in stream

* G+
  * Since ??? (When it started)
  * 1516 Followers
  * 253 Following
  * Unsure what to do there. Mainly use it to broadcast to the other two.
  * Was hoping that it can overcome Facebook and Twitter at the same time, but
    it failed
  * 4 posts in 24 hrs
  * 1 annoying "You may know"

* Ask questions
  * Never get answers on Twitter
      * Example: https://twitter.com/mbrochh/status/548232193336967168
  * Often get answers on Facebook if real-life related
  * Sometimes get answers on G+, if Python/Django related

* Post food porn
  * Only on Facebook. Always gets a ton of likes.
  * Narcissism: My life tastes better than yours

* Post location porn
  * Remember nice places
  * Recommend places to friends
  * Narcissism: My life is more exciting than yours

## Interesting & paradox observations

* I reserve the most intimate content for Facebook, yet I know that the NSA
  most likely has full access to my profile there 
* On Facebook, I'm trying to become closer friends with people that I have met
  and liked, but it doesn't seem to foster existing relationships at all
* On Twitter, I have a false impression of being close friends with people I
  have never seen (@janl / @cramforce)
* I believe that I built a brand as a consultant, but I never got any client
  through social media. Instead I got all clients through actual work put out
  out there (github profile / answers on IRC channels / mailing lists)
* I somehow hope to leave a mark on this planet in this life and sharing
  knowledge seems to be the obvious way, yet due to the time that social
  networks consume, I blog less. However, in the long run my blog posts are the
  best way to share knowledge because they get indexed by google and people
  constantly come to my blog via google searches. I have no idea if anyone
  reads any social media post a week after it has been posted (probably not).
  Sharing on social media gives powerful knowledge (big data) to the corporations
  running those networks, but not to mankind as such.

## Other notes

* Rule of thumb: Post everything public. No network can be trusted, therefore
  no network should get content that can't be public.

## Consequences

* I still need FB for app development
* I don't need Facebook for anything else / my good friends are not using it
* I don't need G+ for anything
* I need Twitter to discover tech related content
