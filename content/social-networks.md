## Pros & Cons of each network?

* Facebook
  * Pro: Everyone is there
  * Pro: Stay in touch with people you like
  * Pro: Very good iOS client & mobile website
  * Con: My very best friends all don't use it, they only observe
  * Pro/Con: Never-ending interaction
  * Con: Privacy nightmare
  * Con: Once you post, you obsess with the number of likes and comments. 
         Promotes hugely narcissistic network.
  * Con: Fucking ads everywhere
  * Con: Random timelime / reload page and everything is lost / gigantic timesink
  * Con: Walled garden / not indexable
  * Con: Group pressure / no control over data about me because of mentions and
         tags

* Twitter
  * Pro: Public / indexable
  * Pro: Replaced RSS feeds 
  * Pro: Highest quality of content/links that reach me
  * Pro: Least personal information collected about me
  * Pro: Least distractive / best web interface
  * Pro: OK Search
  * Pro: Reliable timeline
  * Pro/Con: OK iOS client
  * Con: Only professionals, no real-life friends (except nerds)
  * Con: Fucking ads getting worse now

* G+
  * Pro: Public / indexable
  * Pro: Good search
  * Pro: Reliable timeline
  * Pro/Con: OK web interface / annoying suggestion posts
  * Con: Least interesting content
  * Con: Groups not moderated, flooded with useless content
  * Con: Discussions full of braindead spam comments

## How do I use social networks at the moment?

* Facebook
  * Since March 2009
  * 361 Friends + 1 Following
  * 58 Followers

* Twitter
  * Since March 2009
  * 8074 Tweets
  * 539 Followers
  * 231 Following

* G+
  * Since ??? (When it started)
  * 1516 Followers
  * 253 Following

* Ask questions
  * Never get answers on Twitter
  * Often get answers on Facebook if real-life related
  * Sometimes get answers on G+, if Python/Django related

* Post food porn
  * Only on Facebook. Always gets a ton of likes.
  * Narcissism: My life tastes better than yours

* Post location porn
  * Remember nice places
  * Recommend places to friends
  * Narcissism: My life is more exciting than yours

## Interesting & paradox observations

* I reserve the most intimate content for Facebook, yet I know that the NSA
  most likely reads this network as well
* On Facebook, I'm trying to become closer friends with people that I have met
  and liked, but it doesn't seem to foster existing relationships at all
* On Twitter, I have a false impression of being close friends with people I
  have never seen (@janl / @cramforce)
* I believe that I built a brand as a consultant, but I never got any client
  through social media. Instead I got all clients through actual work put out
  out there (github profile / answers on IRC channels / mailing lists)

## What do I hope to gain from the usage?

* Stay in touch with people, especially when staying abroad for long periods
* Learn about nice places / activities to do
* Build a personal brand as a consultant
* Learn about new technologies / best practices

* Subconsciously:
  * Gain a followship = illusion of more power to change the world

## Other notes

* Post everything public. No network can be trusted, therefore no network
  should get content that can't be public
