It must be more than six years that I am using
[PasswordMaker](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html) to manage all
my passwords. I think this is the best password tool that could ever exist.
Unfortunately it is a little bit difficult to understand and a little bit
unconvenient to use, but when it comes to cryptography, there is always a
tradeoff between convenience and security: You can't have both at the same
time.

So what do I need from a good password manager?

1. It must enable me to have a unique password for every service that I use
2. It should be available on all devices that I use
3. It must not need any kind of user account with any kind of company
4. It must not store my passwords anywhere
5. It must not comunicate with any API any time
6. I only want to remember one master-password
7. Bonus: I should still be relatively save even if someone knows my master password
