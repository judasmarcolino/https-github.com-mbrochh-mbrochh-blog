It must be more than six years that I am using
[PasswordMaker](http://www.passwordmaker.org/passwordmaker.html) to manage all
my passwords. I think this is the best password tool that could ever exist.
Unfortunately it is a little bit difficult to understand and a little bit
unconvenient to use, but when it comes to cryptography, there is always a
tradeoff between convenience and security: You can't have both at the same
time.
