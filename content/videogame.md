Here are my notes about [Richard Jones'](https://plus.google.com/100267502615190755251/about)
keynote with the title "Why we should all write a video game".

_Edit_: Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpaSS82Jgbg

He starts with a awesomely geeky overview over the history of game computing.
It turns out that with an Amiga or C64 you basically boot up into an
environment that allows you start developing software for that same system.

Unthinkable how much fun we would have if an XBox or PlayStation would allow
us to do the same. It turns out, that a MacBook or a Ubuntu machine comes with
Python installed.

Forward further into the future where iPads and similar consumer devices might
rule the world, it is questionable where the future developers should come
from, since it is almost impossible or at least very very hard and limited to
tinker with these devices. Another problem is, that even _if_ you figure out
how to develop for an iPad, you are again bound to strict rules within the
Apple App Store.

# Tinkering

Lego is great for exploration, as kids can play with architecture and physics.
Other great projects are [bitbeam](https://github.com/hugs/bitbeam),
[Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and of course the
[Raspberry Pie](http://www.raspberrypi.org/), which is currently by far the
cheapest computer in the world. Richard gives some examples of awesome projects
that people have come up with using these tools.

# Code Literacy

* [http://codeyear.com/](http://codeyear.com/)

Everyone should learn coding, but not to become a professional programmer but
rather to get insights into all the gadgets that they are using every day.

* [Beginning Game Development with Python and Pygame](http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Game-Development-Python-Pygame/dp/1590598725?tag=duckduckgo-d-20)

Participate in PyWeek and just create something! Don't worry about graphics.
Just get something done that is fun and playable.

# Some Zen

* Get things done!
* Refactor later
* Simple is better than complex
* Complex is better than complicated
