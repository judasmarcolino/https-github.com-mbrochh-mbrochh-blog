*Or: How to stay on top of the game*

It seems to me as if every two weeks someone asks for advise on how to learn
Python and Django. The actual answer should be: "*Learn how to use Google,
first!*" because it is really all there right in front of you  but that would
not give me any karma.

If you just want to play around with Django and get a feeling for it, you can
work through [Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
and then follow the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/).
This should take you between one and two weeks. Afterwards you would have an
idea about Python and Django but you would not be able to implement the next
Facebook.

If you want to make a change in your career and earn real money by creating
web applications there is a slightly longer answer. After all, this is IT and
it turns out that it is a bit more complex than just [turning it off an on
again](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p85xwZ_OLX0).

In fact, working with Python and Django is like a marathon. Everything changes.
All the time. Last month you discovered asset pipelines to compress your CSS
files.  Last week SASS entered the stage and you need to learn that and
yesterday you heard that Compass on top of SASS is all the rage now. And as
this component of your stack (Stylesheets) evolves there are three or four
different packages competing against each other on Github, Bitbucket and Google
Code. Well... maybe not on Google Code but you get the idea.

No need to say that there are several dozen more components that are ten times
more complex than stylesheets. And they all change, too. Don't get me wrong,
I'm not complaining. This situation is not bad at all. It is a sign that this
technology is widely popular, that there is a vibrant community and that you
can safely bet your financial future on it.

Now if you are the CTO of a startup or just an independant software consultant
you really really want to know what is going on. I guess during the last four
years I have spent about 30.000 hours trying to stay on top of the Django game,
so here is my slightly larger answer:

## Overview

All you need is a computer, a state of the art smartphone (preferably Android)
and at least half a year of your time and passion (at least four hours a day).

The good news is: Everything that we need is free and available on the
internet. Your only investment is your spare time.

The bad news is: The internet is an insanely versatile mountain of knowledge
and what we need is hidden in all kinds of different media like ebooks, blogs,
online documentations, mailing lists, RSS feeds, issue trackers, wikis, social
media profiles, newsletters, chat rooms, slides and sometimes really just in
the head of another developer.

I will describe how you can add all these ressources to your daily routine in a
way that allows you to stay focused on your work and to live a normal life.
