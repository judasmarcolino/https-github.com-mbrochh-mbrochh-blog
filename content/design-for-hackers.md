* One of the greatest introductions I have ever read. Very honest and personal
  tone, makes me want to read on.
* Why should we read this book? We need "design literacy". In today's world it
  has become easier than ever to create designs but what most of us don't know
  is that with every piece of design that we create, we do communicate on very
  subtle levels. Without design literacy we are likely to miscommunicate.

# Part 1: Understanding Design

## Chapter 1: Why Design Matters

"Design is the fundamental soul of a human-made creation that ends up
expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product." - Steve Jobs

We are given the example of the Pantheon in Rome. One might wonder why such a
pile of bricks repeatedly makes people's jaws drop when they first enter it.

It is because its purpose was to create a place for the gods and therefore each
and every design decision was made to serve this purpose. From the building
material, to shapes, to colors... everything is interconnected and forms the
great end result.

As a good designer, you don't need to be able to have exceptional drawing
skills. Chances are that you will be only good at drawing one thing, like
ponies. You need to _understand_ how things in the real world really work.

So this book will not teach us how to become good painters, but it will teach
us to properly analyze and understand existing designs.

## Chapter 2: The Purpose of Design

"Design is the manifestation of many different layers that make up a product."

The book will primarily deal with visual design as this is the main aspect that
makes up the design of websites. We shall learn a new way of seeing the world
and be able to reverse engineer a good design when we see it.

_Visual design_ is a component of the discipline of user experience design.
Other components are _Usability_ and _Content_.

Sometimes a visual design is ugly but still good enough because the usability
and content might already solve the underlying problem perfectly well (i.e.
[www.craiglist.org](http://www.craiglist.org)). Other times an outstanding
visual design might just be what gives you an advantage over your customers
(i.e. Apple).

When analysing the user experience of a given product, you can help yourself by
creating a set of __user personas__, a list of imaginary customers which might
interact with the product and have certain needs. Then you would describe
certain __use cases__ (or _user stories_) and therefore find out about crucial
requirements that your product must fulfil. As a next step you might want to
use __wireframes__ to create a first prototype that shows how the requirements
could be met on an actual website.
