Title: My experience with zsh
Slug: zsh
Category: Blog
Tags: unix, shell, zsh, programming
status: draft

* Installation is simple on OSX

    ::sh
    brew install zsh
    weget TODO

* Needed to load virtualenvwrapper manually again but it is quite fast anyways
* Awesome: Type the first letter of a command you did recently and press arrow
  up
* Mega awesome: Do that while you are in another folder and see the paths of
  that command being altered so that it will still work
* Standard color scheme and shell prompt and aliases are great and pretty much
  the same as my old bash setup.
* The scripting language syntax seems to be a bit different, I had to change
  one line in my .bashrc.virtualenvwrapper script and comment out a few
  more lines.
* I asked a question about this on IRC in #zsh and got the correct answer
  immediately. Nice and friendly communit,
