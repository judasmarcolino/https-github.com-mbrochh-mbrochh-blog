* Screenshots and gameplay videos got me interested immediately
* Weird language draws me into the unique fantasy world immediately
* Music is wonderful, just what I expected
* First fight ends in frustration, because I don't know how to draw my sword
  on the MacBook's trackpad and the in-game instruction seems to resemble a
  magic mouse, which I did not understand since I never used one. So it was
  just a doubleclick, which I discovered by chance when hammering randomly onto
  the keyboard
* When the first boss chases me, I actually feel excited. I allow him to kill
  me and I am glad to find out that I will be re-spawned just at the beginning
  of that scene. That's the kind of gameplay that I like.
* After maybe an hour of playing I have solved 23%... really? I would be a
  shame if the game would be that short.
* Went into the dreamland of the Woodfella. Quite funny and so many mushrooms.
  I wondered what they are good for, but could not discover anything. The dream
  ends super simple, just follow the singing bear. Weird.
* Later I discovered that the mushrooms help to find stuff in the woods. I
  wonder if they spawn all the time of I have to be smart when to use them and
  when not. They seem to be limited, what a shame.
* Rubbing the rainbows. What a cool idea.
* After my third session I'm 36% into the game.
* After my 4th session I'm 42% into the game and won the first boss fight. It
  is really cool how your moves are in sync with the music which indeed is
  super awesome and gets me into a mood of excitement while doing the rather
  simple fight. However it was just hard enough to take me 2 tries to
  understand the pattern and two more tries to finish the stage. At every
  failure the book gives more hints on how to solve the boss, which is nice as
  a game should entertain and not frustrate.
* I also like how the game closes the curtain after each chapter and asks for a
  break. I think for a short game like this it gives you the chance to think
  about what you have seen and heard (and it indeed is the stuff that gets you
  thinking, very artistic and poetic and great music). And after a while the
  desire to play more will arise which will give you an overall good memory
  about the game later ("I constantly felt like I wanted to return to the
  game"). If I just finished this in one session I would probably complain that
  it only took me 3 hours to beat the game.
* After my 5th session I am 53% into the game. Instead of moving through the
  gate as the game suggested I went to the hut and took a nap. Luckily it was
  a full moon so the dreamland had more souls to discover and led me to a whole
  new realm. As usual, music and visuals are wonderful. I love the game and I
  hated to stop the dream world and go to sleep. What if it kicks me out since
  full moon will be over tomorrow?
* After my 6th session I am 56% in, although I felt that I must have much much
  more progress. For the first time I had the feeling that I might be stuck, so 
  I did what you do in every adventure game and ran back all the way to the old
  places I had visited before. Luckily it was still a bright moon and I could
  talk to some ghosts, which clearly hinted that the rest of the game will
  probably take place in the dreamworld. Also, it seems as if I have freed
  another soul at the other side of the lake last time, so this time when I
  crossed the lake, I found the impossible island and the next end boss. And
  boy this time its going to be a tough dance. I'm not sure if it is possible
  to master that one with the trackpad, now it becomes very clear that this
  game was designed for tapping on the iPad. Oh and I sat with the musician
  in the dream world and listened to his whole song this time. I realized
  that you can use the bushes to play tunes along with him and I totally
  got lost in it, playing my own improvised song while he was playing his.
  It was beautiful.
* My 7th session was a short one. I came back to beat the 2nd end boss. I found
  out that the keys ``z`` and ``x`` can be used for block and attack, which
  made the task much much easier. With a trackpad it would have been
  impossible. I didn't have the motivation to go on with game because I can
  already guess that I can only make progress when there is a dark moon, which
  will be in about half a month.
* My 8th session was about 45 minutes and ended with 92% into the game. From
  the hints given in the game I knew that I had to walk through the dream world
  again on a full moon but it was not a full moon yet. I walked through the
  dream world anyways and found that singing bear. He ran into the big tree
  where I had to fight against him. At the end of the fight I had the option to
  slay him but I decided to let him go, therefore I got a key to the moon cave
  where I was able to adjust the moon. Unfortunately, running to the dream world
  again was a bit repetitive now. I had to summon more spirits and the concept
  was all too common now, I didn't even need any mushrooms to guide me. But
  still, after defeating the last end boss, thanks to cool music and story
  telling I had the feeling as if I had achieved something great.
