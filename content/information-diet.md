So this was one week without social media. Some stats:

*Google+:*

Reading up everything I missed took me about 10 minutes. As usual
there was not a single link of interest. I just liked the photo uploaded by a
friend who visited a Coldplay concert.

Conclusion: On the one hand it is sad that there is so little good content in
Google+, on the other hand it is good because I now know that I can safely
ignore it for a week without really missing anything important.

*Facebook:*

Impossible to guess how much I missed. The notifications only go
back three days. Skimming through them I found the usual stuff: One person
over-sharing her each and every thought. One person posting tons of links to
satiric cartoons and a handful of people with picture uploads and status
updates.

Next I scrolled down the timeline for a few minutes. I realised that it is
impossible to find interesting posts or links between all those pictures. As a
consequence I realised that I am just looking at tons of pictures from people I
rarely ever interact with. This is the ultimate curse of facebook. It shuts
down your brain and makes you gaze at stupid pictures.

Conclusion: Facebook is nice to message people because I don't need to remember
their email addresses. It is also nice to RSVP for events and get updates about
the event. Other than that it is totally irrelevant for my life.

*Twitter:*

For Twitter I am using TweetLanes on my Nexus 7 as a client. I love
it because it remembers your last-read tweet and stays there so that you have
to scroll up to reach the top again. This way you can read each and every
tweet. I get 350 Tweets per day on average and it takes me 10 minutes to read
all tweets of a day. On average I mark 5 tweets per day for later reading.
Unfortunately it seems as if you can only scroll back 3 days in your timeline.
This means that Twitter forces me to come back AT LEAST every three days or I
will miss something. Fuck you, Twitter.

Conclusion: Twitter is still the most important source to get all the
information that I need in order to stay "on top of the game" but the three
days restriction is so damn annoying that Google Reader might finally become my
main source for information again.

*Google Reader:*

I can't tell how much information got piled up on Google
Reader because I couldn't resist to read it during the last week when I
triggered long running deployments (up to 5 minutes). I should probably have
about 2800 unread items and it would probably take me three hours to scan
through all of them.

Conclusion: Google Reader is the most reliable source of information and the
only one where I can reliably read each and every post, no matter how long I
stayed away from it. During the next weeks I will put some effort into
organising my subscriptions and get rid of some high volume sources that just
add noise to my "timeline".

*Real life:*

This week was fantastic. I saw the whole first season of Game Of
Thrones. I finished a book (The Diamond Age). I met a lot of friends in the
evenings. I meditated twice a day (morning and evening, 45 minutes per
session). My TODO list which only grew and grew during the last few months is
down to an all time low of outstanding tasks. I have inbox zero in all my (8)
email inboxes.

At first I suffered from the urge to pick up my phone and read Twitter /
Facebook / G+ when there was the slightest sign of having free brain cycles
(i.e. when the tests ran or when I sat on the toilet). To trick myself I
removed the app icons from the home screens of my mobile devices. This was
enough to remind myself: "DO NOT TOUCH THESE APPS".

Secondly I created filters in GMail to label and archive ALL notification
emails from ALL online services that I use. Especially Facebook sends shitloads
of notifications and each and every time my phone rings or blinks it pulls me
out of my current train of thoughts. Now my phone is silent almost the whole
day and my mind is razor sharp at any given task.

The silent phone has another nice side effect: When meeting people I don't feel
the urge to look at it all the time which results in much better and more
meaningful conversations.
