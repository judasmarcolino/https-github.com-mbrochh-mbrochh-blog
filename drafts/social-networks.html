<p>The World Health Organization counts the <a href="http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/daly_rates/en/">years of life
lost</a> due to
disabilities and mortality every year. Someone should do the same for social
networks: I don't really see the difference between a person not contributing
to society because she is tied to a wheel-chair and a person watching cat
movies on YouTube or playing Candy Crush. Social networks are like sugar,
cigarettes, alcohol and fast food: We all somehow know that they are unhealthy
but we just don't have the strength to stay away from them.</p>
<h2>Why this post?</h2>
<p>2014 turned out to be a fantastic year for me but I wasn't even half as
productive as I used to be. If I want to get any further in life this year, I
need to change something. I have many ideas on how to improve but one idea
keeps coming back to me:</p>
<p>I need to re-view my social network usage.</p>
<p>In the beginning, I signed up for Twitter and Facebook out of curiosity,
without any special expectations or purpose. I quickly understood how these
networks could be used to achieve certain goals and so I had created a personal
agenda on how to use them (and why to use them). However, over time, they
became mainstream and changed the way we use the internet, they changed the way
we interact with other people and maybe even the way we work as a society.</p>
<p>Until now, I never mindfully looked at these changes and asked myself if they
are good or bad and if I want to be part of this or not. It all boils down to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know why I post food porn on Facebook. Everyone seems to do it, so I
just do it as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>My social network stats</h2>
<p>I'm sure there are hundreds of different kinds of social network users, so
let's try to find out what kind of user I am. If you are similar to me, the
rest of this post might be useful to you. If you are very different, you might
just take the questions I asked myself as an inspiration to reflect on your own
social network usage and maybe publish your own findings somewhere as well.</p>
<p><img alt="Table with my social network stats" src="http://martinbrochhaus.com/images/social-networks-stats.png" /></p>
<p>I'm just looking at the three big players here: Facebook, Twitter and Google+.
I spend a ton of time on Reddit as well, but I don't have any "friends" there,
so I will ignore Reddit for this post.</p>
<p>I have 271 friends on Facebook. I started the new year with deleting 100
friends, so those 271 are people who I have met in real life, most probably
more than once.</p>
<p>I'm actually following 226 accounts on Twitter, but I keep a list of "people".
All accounts who are not in that list are bots, products, organisations,
governments, communities and so on. To make the comparisons between the three
networks more fair, I will assume that I only follow the 137 people on Twitter
(because non-people usually post higher volumes). While I know everyone I
follow on Facebook personally, I know almost no one on Twitter. Here I follow
great developers and public figures in the hopes of getting news about new
technologies.</p>
<p>On Google+ I'm following 253 people. I added a ton of real-life friends to my
circles, but those are mostly empty and unused profiles, the rest is pretty
much the same people that I also follow on Twitter. Here I was hoping to get
a combination of Facebook and Twitter - the best of both worlds - but
unfortunately that hope never turned into a reality.</p>
<h2>Why do people use social media?</h2>
<p>I have my own reasons, but obviously, there seem to be some universal factors
that suck almost everyone into social media.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onepoll.com/10-reasons-people-use-social-media/">This post by OnePoll</a>
has a list of ten very reasonable reasons:</p>
<p><em>Social interaction</em> and <em>expression of opinions</em> are the obvious one. You can
find a sub-culture for pretty much anything on the internet, so you will be
able to socially interact with like-minded people, no matter how crazy or niche
the topic of your interest is.</p>
<p><em>Information seeking</em>, <em>passing time</em>, <em>entertainment</em>, <em>relaxation</em>, <em>things
to talk about</em>, <em>convenience</em> and <em>knowing about others</em> all seem to fall into
a broader category of "fighting boredom".</p>
<p>The interesting thing is this: Without much thought, I can easily think of
better ways for almost all of the above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to seek information? Use Google (more direct, better results)!</li>
<li>Want to express an opinion? Get politically involved. Fifty likes on Facebook
  doesn't mean anyone cares about your opinion.</li>
<li>Want to pass time? Go for a walk or do sports (healthier).</li>
<li>Want to be entertained? Read a book or watch one of the many movies on your
  watch-later list (more direct, better quality).</li>
<li>Want to relax? Do mindfulness meditation (seriously, try it)!</li>
<li>Want to know about others? Meet them (better quality, by just using social
  media you will get a false and incomplete image of a person anyways)!</li>
</ul>
<p>I think <em>Convenience</em> is the culprit. Social networks give you the illusion
that you can somehow get all of the above, anytime, any place, in small and
quickly to digest portions. Maybe I <em>can</em> use Facebook to relax.  Maybe I <em>can</em>
use it to seek information. And maybe I <em>can</em> use it to be entertained. But
whatever goal I had in mind when I opened Facebook, Facebook doesn't know about
my intentions, so it offers me all options at the same time, which only
distracts me. It tries to do all the things at once, as a result it is not
really good at any of those things.</p>
<h2>What do social networks offer that can't be solved with other tools?</h2>
<h2>Pros &amp; Cons of each network?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Pro: Everyone is there</li>
<li>Pro: Stay in touch with people you like</li>
<li>Pro: Very good iOS client &amp; mobile website</li>
<li>Pro: Easy to have conversations</li>
<li>Pro: Easy to edit typos in posts</li>
<li>Con: My very best friends all don't use it, they only observe</li>
<li>Pro/Con: Never-ending interaction</li>
<li>Con: Privacy nightmare</li>
<li>Con: Once you post, you obsess with the number of likes and comments. 
         Promotes hugely narcissistic network.</li>
<li>Con: Fucking ads everywhere</li>
<li>Con: Random timelime / reload page and everything is lost / gigantic timesink</li>
<li>Con: Walled garden / not indexable</li>
<li>Con: Group pressure / no control over data about me because of mentions and
         tags</li>
<li>
<p>Verdict: Chaotic time sink. Not really worth using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twitter</p>
</li>
<li>Pro: Public / indexable</li>
<li>Pro: Replaced RSS feeds </li>
<li>Pro: Highest quality of content/links that reach me</li>
<li>Pro: Least personal information collected about me</li>
<li>Pro: Least distractive / best web interface</li>
<li>Pro: OK Search</li>
<li>Pro: Reliable static timeline</li>
<li>Pro/Con: OK iOS client</li>
<li>Con: Only professionals, no real-life friends (except nerds)</li>
<li>Con: Fucking ads getting worse now</li>
<li>Con: Terrible to have conversations / discussions</li>
<li>Con: Can't edit typos in posts</li>
<li>
<p>Verdict: Best network for professional tasks, very good content, very
             little distractions &amp; bullshit. Almost all that I know as a
             developer was picked up on Twitter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G+</p>
</li>
<li>Pro: Public / indexable</li>
<li>Pro: Good search</li>
<li>Pro: Easy to add typos in posts</li>
<li>Pro: Easy to have conversations</li>
<li>Pro/Con: Reliable static timeline / unless you start tuning down groups &amp; circles</li>
<li>Pro/Con: OK web interface / annoying suggestion posts</li>
<li>Con: Least interesting content</li>
<li>Con: Groups not moderated, flooded with useless content</li>
<li>Con: Discussions full of braindead spam comments</li>
<li>Verdict: This would be the best network, the only problem is that nobody is
             is using it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Who profits from social networks?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The owner</li>
<li>Ad revenue</li>
<li>Big data insights</li>
<li>Subtle controll of the masses</li>
<li>Content producers</li>
<li>Inbound traffic / content going viral </li>
<li>Users</li>
<li>Organizing events with many people could be easier (i.e. Python User Group Meetups)</li>
<li>Tools for creating communities </li>
</ul>
<h2>Why do people want to use social networks at all?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Be your own celebrity?</li>
<li>Perfect time-filler</li>
</ul>
<h2>What do I hope to gain from the usage?</h2>

  are worth your time</li>
<li>
<p>Learn about new technologies / best practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subconsciously:</p>
</li>
<li>Gain a followship = illusion of more power to change the world</li>
</ul>

<li>1516 Followers</li>
<li>253 Following</li>
<li>Unsure what to do there. Mainly use it to broadcast to the other two.</li>
<li>Was hoping that it can overcome Facebook and Twitter at the same time, but
    it failed</li>
<li>4 posts in 24 hrs</li>
<li>
<p>1 annoying "You may know"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ask questions</p>
</li>
<li>Never get answers on Twitter<ul>
<li>Example: https://twitter.com/mbrochh/status/548232193336967168</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Often get answers on Facebook if real-life related</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes get answers on G+, if Python/Django related</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post food porn</p>
</li>
<li>Only on Facebook. Always gets a ton of likes.</li>
<li>
<p>Narcissism: My life tastes better than yours</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Post location porn</p>
</li>
<li>Remember nice places</li>
<li>Recommend places to friends</li>
<li>Narcissism: My life is more exciting than yours</li>
</ul>
<h2>Interesting &amp; paradox observations</h2>
<ul>
<li>I reserve the most intimate content for Facebook, yet I know that the NSA
  most likely has full access to my profile there </li>
<li>On Facebook, I'm trying to become closer friends with people that I have met
  and liked, but it doesn't seem to foster existing relationships at all</li>
<li>On Twitter, I have a false impression of being close friends with people I
  have never seen (@janl / @cramforce)</li>
<li>I believe that I built a brand as a consultant, but I never got any client
  through social media. Instead I got all clients through actual work put out
  out there (github profile / answers on IRC channels / mailing lists)</li>
<li>I somehow hope to leave a mark on this planet in this life and sharing
  knowledge seems to be the obvious way, yet due to the time that social
  networks consume, I blog less. However, in the long run my blog posts are the
  best way to share knowledge because they get indexed by google and people
  constantly come to my blog via google searches. I have no idea if anyone
  reads any social media post a week after it has been posted (probably not).
  Sharing on social media gives powerful knowledge (big data) to the corporations
  running those networks, but not to mankind as such.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rule of thumb: Post everything public. No network can be trusted, therefore
  no network should get content that can't be public.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<ul>
<li>I still need FB for app development</li>
<li>I don't need Facebook for anything else / my good friends are not using it</li>
<li>I don't need G+ for anything</li>
<li>I need Twitter to discover tech related content</li>
</ul>
