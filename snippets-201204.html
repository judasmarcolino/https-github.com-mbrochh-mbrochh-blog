            <p>This is my second post in a series of (almost) monthly posts about small bits
and pieces of wisdom that amazed me. You can find the first post here:
<a href="http://martinbrochhaus.com/2012/02/snippets-201202.html">Snippets of February 2012</a></p>
<h1>Ubuntu: Static Application Switcher</h1>
<p>App switiching with ALT+TAB became a major pain since Ubuntu introduced that
horrible Unity interface. The simple solution is to open CompizConfig Settings
Manager and enable "Static Application Switcher" under "Window Management".</p>
<p>I think it is much much more intuitive and effective to have a static list of
windows instead of an endlessly rotating one.</p>
<h1>Scrolling and Copy &amp; Paste in GNU Screen</h1>
<p>I really got to love screen during the past 4 months and usually work in a
session with 7 windows open. The problem is, when I swtich to window 1 to see
the output of my tests and there is a huge traceback, I cannot use my terminal
to scroll up because I will scroll into whatever I saw in the windows before
(probably Vim).</p>
<p>The trick is to use Screen's scroll mode by pressing <code>CTRL+A ESC</code>. It will
display a message saying that copy mode is activated and now you can move the
cursor with the usual Vim keybindings. Pressing <code>SPACE</code> or <code>ENTER</code> once
sets a marker and pressing it again will copy everything between the first and
second marker into the clipboard.</p>
<p>You can paste the clipboard via <code>CTRL+A ]</code>. Yea, I know. Read the fucking
manual... :)</p>
<h1>SSH Keep Alive</h1>
<p>Whenever I need to SSH into my various servers I get connection timeouts all
the time. Somehow most people don't suffer from this so this seems to be a
problem with my Ubuntu installation, but recently I found a solution that works
for me:</p>
<p>On my servers, I now set this:</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># in ~/.ssh/config:</span>
ServerAliveInterval 60

<span class="c"># in ~/.screenrc</span>
caption always <span class="s1">&#39;%c:%s&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Now I just need to remember to start a screen session right after I login. The
screen setting will render a clock at the bottom of the screen which is enough
to have a steady bit of traffic going through SSH for not kicking me out of the
server any more.</p>
<h1>Nerdy IT Jargon</h1>
<p>I can't remember where I learned about these but I love them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;=&gt;</code> is called the spaceship operator</li>
<li>Writing variable names <code>LikeThis</code> is called CamelCase. I knew this for
  years, but:</li>
<li>Writing variable names <code>like_this</code> is called <code>snake_case</code>. Very Pythonic,
  isn't it?</li>
</ul>
<h1>HG Facepalm</h1>
<p>I can't believe that this actually happened, but if you have something from
Bitbucket in your requirements.txt and try to pip install it, you might get
a weird error saying that the pip call to Bitbucket returned code 1 and this
pip stops installing.</p>
<p>This is because a recent version of Mercurial returns 1 if <code>hg pull</code> doesn't
return any new changes (which happens most of the time).</p>
<p>However, pip (and almost every other software on this planet) thinks that a
return value of 1 means a failure and just stops.</p>
<p>Thankfully Mercurial fixed this quickly and reverted that change, so if you are
suffering from the "bad" version, you might want to upgrade your Mercurial
installation.</p>

</ul>
<h1>Great blog posts</h1>
<p>I currently have 190 subsriptions in Google Reader and I am following 298
awesome people on Twitter. These lists are carefully curated by myself and I
usually enjoy reading almost everything that comes in through those streams.
Here are some posts that, to me, should be spread as far as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.dailygood.org/view.php?sid=194">9 Essential Skills Kids Should Learn</a>
  The longer I work on my own company Bitmazk Pte. Ltd. the more I realize that
  (at least in the IT business) traditional education is completely worthless.
  I have the feeling that I will put in quite some effort to educate my own
  kids in a very different way than I was educated myself. This post gives some
  very very nice ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/su/9IbGnD/zenhabits.net/the-only-guide-to-happiness-youll-ever-need/">The Only Guide to Happiness Youâ€™ll Ever Need</a>
  The title says it all. After reading "Mindfulness in Plain English" several
  times, the pursuit of hapiness has become a very important part of my life
  that I try to consciously improve day after day. I've surely not mastered
  this aspect of my life but I can tell that this list nails it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://carl.flax.ie/dothingstellpeople.html">Do things, tell people</a>
  This. Absolutely true. Whenever I did something in the open, no matter how
  small, lame or unimportant, an incredible chain of events unfolded itself
  in front of me that enriched my life in ways that I can't put into words.
  Please! If you have a little bit of energy left at the end of your day, get
  your ass up, do things, and tell people!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/09/good-agile-bad-agile_27.html">Good Agile, Bad Agile</a>
  It sad but true: This whole Scrumm and Agile movement is a big scam. This
  rant explains why. Thought provoking read.</p>
