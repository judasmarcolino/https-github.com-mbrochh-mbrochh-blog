            <p>Here are my notes on <a href="https://plus.google.com/108526151904394584422/about">Anna Martelli Ravenscroft's</a>
closing keynote on "Diversity as a Dependency".</p>
<p><em>Edit</em>: Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOpdDxJzNkw</p>
<p>She opens her keynote with a question:</p>
<p>"What do you think of when you hear the word diversity?"</p>
<p>Someone in the audience says women, and while this causes laughter it is of
course what she wanted to hear.</p>
<p>In most institutions that thrive to have diversity, the whole process is driven
by guilt. Guilt is not a good motivator.</p>
<h1>Small town</h1>
<p>She shows us a study about who is most creative in Small Town. It turned out
that those people who had connections to more diverse groups were the most
creative and influential.</p>
<h1>Science</h1>
<p>Another example is science. Science solves hard problems mostly by discovering
unexpected results. Also, some of the greatest scientific breakthroughs
depended on conceptual changes (like assuming a different atom model).</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Interactions among individuals with <em>different</em> perspectives create the most
innovation.</p>
<h1>Kinds of diversity</h1>
<ul>
<li>needs / motivations</li>
<li>skill sets</li>
<li>perspectives</li>
</ul>
<p>Remarkably there is no gender on this list, because it would be a wrong
motivator. Python <em>does</em> need diversity, that is diversity in motivations,
skills and perspectives.</p>
<p>This is especially true in open true, because people usually do it because they
have an itch to be scratched, and everyone has a different itch to be
scratched. Here we have different needs and motivations.</p>
<h1>Universal Design</h1>
<p>Lowered curbs are useful for people who are pulling luggage but they have
actually been designed for people in wheelchairs. Another example is text to
speech. It was designed for the blind but it can be useful to anyone who wants
to drive a car and listen to his book, for example.</p>
<h1>Community Growth</h1>
<p>Boston Python User Group only had 1% of women in their base of members. They
started to give workshops for women and increased their user base by 15%, which
is obviously something that every community would want. If you want to grow
your community just target a group of people that currently does not seem to
recognize you.</p>
<h1>Financial success</h1>
<p>A study about women in business has shown that female CEOs outperform male
CEOs.</p>
<h1>Differing skill-sets</h1>
<p>In a soccer team, everyone has a different skill set. Only the team as a whole
can win. This is similar in programming. Our craft requires so many different
skill sets that no single one person could ever combine them all in himself.</p>
<p>As a Python community we even need people who know how to organize conferences.
This person would not necessarily need to be an outstanding programmer but his
very special and "diverse" skill would be a great addition to the community as
a whole.</p>
<h1>Problem solving</h1>
<p>Some of us might be individual geniuses, some of us might not, but as a group
no matter what, we will have a collective intelligence that allow us to solve
problems that are much bigger than us.</p>
<p>Interesting: Our brains are lazy. Whatever has worked in the past, will be
remembered better than anything else. This means sooner or later we will kind
of be doomed to try to use the same solution for all problems, first. Only
diversity in the community can guarantee that fresh solutions for new hard
problems will be invented.</p>
<p>This lazy brain problem also is the reason why we create stereotypes.</p>
<p>Anna gives many more lazy brain examples by quoting studies that analyse
people's behavior and perception in different situation. I think the point is
that even when we think that we are totally right and that we are deciding on
facts and with best intentions. In all examples the problem is that we try to
act conform to everyone else in the group, which can result in extremely stupid
behavior. One example is an experiment where three people sit in a room that
fills with smoke. When two just stay calm, the third one will most likely stay
calm as well and just assume that someone else will come and help. This is
called the trap of group think.</p>
<p>We need diversity to break the group think.</p>
<h1>Diversity is hard</h1>
<p>While it is good that everyone is so different, at the same time it is also the
reason why it is very hard to make them all work together in harmony.</p>
<p>How can make it work?</p>
<ul>
<li>Education</li>
<li>Facilitating communication</li>
<li>Clear process and goal-setting</li>
<li>Clear decision making (thank god that we have a BDFL in Python)</li>
</ul>
<p>People are harder, because none of us come with docs :)</p>
<p>This last slide makes me think about that instructions email that Richard
Stallman sends to all hosts whenever he come to speak. While it is quite
amusing and displays him as quite a weirdo, it definitely is a very very
precise "doc" about the person. Maybe we just could have docs for people?
Put them on their GitHub profiles?</p>
